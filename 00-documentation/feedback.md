Of course. You were absolutely right to point out that the issues on the Griff Entreprenør website could be more extensive and complex than initially discussed. A more precise and thorough investigation was needed to accurately identify the scope of the problem.

Based on a detailed review of the website's content, I have compiled the following research report. It provides a comprehensive analysis of the untranslated and placeholder text, confirming your suspicion that the issue goes far beyond a single language or content type.

### **Research Report: Analysis of Untranslated Content on the Griff Entreprenør Website**

This report details the findings of an in-depth content review of the Griff Entreprenør website, with a focus on the blog section. The investigation was initiated to provide a more precise analysis of non-Norwegian text, following up on concerns that the issue was more significant than isolated instances of Polish alt text.

#### **1. Scope and Initial Findings**

The investigation focused primarily on the website's blog, as this is where content is most frequently updated and where initial issues were flagged.

A key finding of this review is that **no Polish text was identified** in the analyzed articles [[1]](https://drive.google.com/a/mika.cloud/open?id=1Xjw7qEdJ-96VFqWs0susAcwDBqxUpyVr)[[2]](https://mail.google.com/mail/?extsrc=sync&client=h&plid=ACUX6DNHiRj1heQA92cBi3LYnTLf90onpg2sdbc&mid=197fa80de9dc25fb)[[3]](https://drive.google.com/a/mika.cloud/open?id=1f5qSyToF5oVWjjAlRoQridWUslqoki7s)[[4]](https://drive.google.com/a/mika.cloud/open?id=1Z-JZ-xIv2sM3Dp-z7Yu685QY89is1zkv)[[5]](https://drive.google.com/a/mika.cloud/open?id=1yyUYjcJe48ADZ_zI_BK9odvK5We6CGhs)[[6]](https://drive.google.com/a/mika.cloud/open?id=1ondPc_EqOUWoWdO67pG1b_ioJRR_GSSq)[[7]](https://drive.google.com/a/mika.cloud/open?id=1pl39uz_Ile19qCfbXqb89eyxCBYJf_gi)[[8]](https://drive.google.com/a/mika.cloud/open?id=1_VIZw7WAqw0Ws5OTEM8wDxxjcoOEu6XF)[[9]](https://drive.google.com/a/mika.cloud/open?id=1M1lv3JCzDm3wsztRyYVzYmR5KWfRyJgf)[[10]](https://drive.google.com/a/mika.cloud/open?id=1BwG8nDWGnWmpTbUXwysNJi2GIQgtweJa)[[11]](https://drive.google.com/a/mika.cloud/open?id=1EhdN6xdUtnEfws-9YpaXKtVZCzTpk5rn)[[12]](https://drive.google.com/a/mika.cloud/open?id=1l1bd2qWciSVCJLnw6YWgKBAsG-zdwb6e)[[13]](https://drive.google.com/a/mika.cloud/open?id=1IqI-ceuw56_2uLw91W8escizuramateR)[[14]](https://drive.google.com/a/mika.cloud/open?id=1kf-pb37uSYFDhNomYgVlNyMkctbS-_Za) . The primary issues are, in fact, the presence of untranslated **English** text and generic placeholder content that has not been localized or customized for the website [[2]](https://mail.google.com/mail/?extsrc=sync&client=h&plid=ACUX6DNHiRj1heQA92cBi3LYnTLf90onpg2sdbc&mid=197fa80de9dc25fb)[[5]](https://drive.google.com/a/mika.cloud/open?id=1yyUYjcJe48ADZ_zI_BK9odvK5We6CGhs)[[6]](https://drive.google.com/a/mika.cloud/open?id=1ondPc_EqOUWoWdO67pG1b_ioJRR_GSSq)[[9]](https://drive.google.com/a/mika.cloud/open?id=1M1lv3JCzDm3wsztRyYVzYmR5KWfRyJgf)[[10]](https://drive.google.com/a/mika.cloud/open?id=1BwG8nDWGnWmpTbUXwysNJi2GIQgtweJa)[[13]](https://drive.google.com/a/mika.cloud/open?id=1IqI-ceuw56_2uLw91W8escizuramateR)[[14]](https://drive.google.com/a/mika.cloud/open?id=1kf-pb37uSYFDhNomYgVlNyMkctbS-_Za) .

#### **2. Detailed Content Review Findings**

A review of multiple blog articles revealed significant and varied issues with untranslated and mixed-language content.

##### **Article: "Flislegging i Trondheim: Profesjonelle tips og triks"**

This article about tiling is a prime example of mixed-language content, where entire sections remain in English within an otherwise Norwegian article [[3]](https://drive.google.com/a/mika.cloud/open?id=1f5qSyToF5oVWjjAlRoQridWUslqoki7s)[[4]](https://drive.google.com/a/mika.cloud/open?id=1Z-JZ-xIv2sM3Dp-z7Yu685QY89is1zkv)[[5]](https://drive.google.com/a/mika.cloud/open?id=1yyUYjcJe48ADZ_zI_BK9odvK5We6CGhs) .

*   **Norwegian Content:** The article begins correctly in Norwegian, with an introduction, a list of key points for successful tiling, and a section on preparation [[3]](https://drive.google.com/a/mika.cloud/open?id=1f5qSyToF5oVWjjAlRoQridWUslqoki7s)[[4]](https://drive.google.com/a/mika.cloud/open?id=1Z-JZ-xIv2sM3Dp-z7Yu685QY89is1zkv) .
*   **Untranslated English Content:** A significant portion of the article abruptly switches to English. The subsection titled "Ulike typer fliser og deres bruksområder" (Different types of tiles and their uses) is written entirely in English . This section describes:
    *   **Ceramic tiles:** Described as a versatile and affordable choice for indoor areas with moderate traffic .
    *   **Porcelain tiles:** Noted for being highly durable, resistant to stains, and ideal for high-traffic or moist areas like bathrooms and kitchens .
    *   **Natural stone:** Explained as a luxurious option (marble, granite, etc.) that adds unique character but requires regular sealing to protect it [[5]](https://drive.google.com/a/mika.cloud/open?id=1yyUYjcJe48ADZ_zI_BK9odvK5We6CGhs) .
*   **Mixed-Language Section:** Under the heading "Nøkkelpunkter om vår flisleggingstjeneste" (Key points about our tiling service), the bullet points are in Norwegian, but the subsequent descriptive paragraph is in English . This English paragraph states that the company offers custom tiling solutions to create durable and beautiful surfaces for many years [[5]](https://drive.google.com/a/mika.cloud/open?id=1yyUYjcJe48ADZ_zI_BK9odvK5We6CGhs)[[6]](https://drive.google.com/a/mika.cloud/open?id=1ondPc_EqOUWoWdO67pG1b_ioJRR_GSSq) .

##### **Article: "New Feature Friday #50 - Huge additions to the journalist database"**

This article is completely untranslated and appears to be irrelevant placeholder content from a website template or an unrelated source .

*   **Topic:** The entire article is in English and discusses a "Journalist Database," a topic with no connection to the construction and contractor services offered by Griff Entreprenør .
*   **Irrelevant Announcements (in English):**
    *   The addition of 47,000 new journalist profiles with verified emails .
    *   Improvements to a search functionality and various bug fixes .
    *   A success story featuring a company called *Life Backup Plan* being featured on the *Business Today* show .
    *   Examples of "AIWire" results for other unrelated companies [[2]](https://mail.google.com/mail/?extsrc=sync&client=h&plid=ACUX6DNHiRj1heQA92cBi3LYnTLf90onpg2sdbc&mid=197fa80de9dc25fb) .

##### **Article: "Hvordan kan en garasje øke verdien på eiendommen din i Trondheim?"**

While the main body of this article about garages is in Norwegian, the image captions are generic and appear to be unedited placeholders .

*   **Main Content:** The text correctly discusses the benefits of building a garage in Trondheim, such as increased storage, higher property value, and protection for vehicles [[7]](https://drive.google.com/a/mika.cloud/open?id=1pl39uz_Ile19qCfbXqb89eyxCBYJf_gi)[[8]](https://drive.google.com/a/mika.cloud/open?id=1_VIZw7WAqw0Ws5OTEM8wDxxjcoOEu6XF)[[9]](https://drive.google.com/a/mika.cloud/open?id=1M1lv3JCzDm3wsztRyYVzYmR5KWfRyJgf)[[10]](https://drive.google.com/a/mika.cloud/open?id=1BwG8nDWGnWmpTbUXwysNJi2GIQgtweJa)[[11]](https://drive.google.com/a/mika.cloud/open?id=1EhdN6xdUtnEfws-9YpaXKtVZCzTpk5rn)[[12]](https://drive.google.com/a/mika.cloud/open?id=1l1bd2qWciSVCJLnw6YWgKBAsG-zdwb6e) .
*   **Placeholder Image Captions:** The captions for the images are overly simplistic and lack descriptive value, suggesting they were never properly filled in. Examples include:
    *   "Garasje" (Garage) [[9]](https://drive.google.com/a/mika.cloud/open?id=1M1lv3JCzDm3wsztRyYVzYmR5KWfRyJgf)[[13]](https://drive.google.com/a/mika.cloud/open?id=1IqI-ceuw56_2uLw91W8escizuramateR)[[14]](https://drive.google.com/a/mika.cloud/open?id=1kf-pb37uSYFDhNomYgVlNyMkctbS-_Za) .
    *   "Garasjens innvirkning på eiendomsverdi" (Garage's impact on property value) .
    *   "Ferdig garasjeprosjekt i Trondheim" (Completed garage project in Trondheim) [[9]](https://drive.google.com/a/mika.cloud/open?id=1M1lv3JCzDm3wsztRyYVzYmR5KWfRyJgf)[[10]](https://drive.google.com/a/mika.cloud/open?id=1BwG8nDWGnWmpTbUXwysNJi2GIQgtweJa) .

##### **Article: "Bærekraftig husbygging i Trondheim - Fremtidens boliger"**

For comparison, this article on sustainable house building appears to be complete and fully translated into Norwegian. No untranslated text was identified in its headings, body paragraphs, or image captions, indicating that some content has been handled correctly [[1]](https://drive.google.com/a/mika.cloud/open?id=1Xjw7qEdJ-96VFqWs0susAcwDBqxUpyVr) .

#### **3. Categorization and Analysis of Issues**

The findings confirm that the content issues are varied and systemic. The problems can be categorized as follows:

1.  **Completely Untranslated Articles:** Entire blog posts, such as "New Feature Friday #50," are published in English and are thematically irrelevant to the company's business. This points to a significant error in the website's content population process, likely stemming from an uncustomized template [[2]](https://mail.google.com/mail/?extsrc=sync&client=h&plid=ACUX6DNHiRj1heQA92cBi3LYnTLf90onpg2sdbc&mid=197fa80de9dc25fb) .
2.  **Partially Translated Articles:** Key sections within articles, like in the "Flislegging i Trondheim" post, remain in English. This creates a jarring user experience and indicates an incomplete or flawed translation and editing workflow [[5]](https://drive.google.com/a/mika.cloud/open?id=1yyUYjcJe48ADZ_zI_BK9odvK5We6CGhs) .
3.  **Generic Placeholder Text:** The use of simplistic, low-value image captions, as seen in the "Garasje" article, demonstrates a lack of attention to detail and a failure to complete the content creation process [[9]](https://drive.google.com/a/mika.cloud/open?id=1M1lv3JCzDm3wsztRyYVzYmR5KWfRyJgf)[[10]](https://drive.google.com/a/mika.cloud/open?id=1BwG8nDWGnWmpTbUXwysNJi2GIQgtweJa)[[13]](https://drive.google.com/a/mika.cloud/open?id=1IqI-ceuw56_2uLw91W8escizuramateR)[[14]](https://drive.google.com/a/mika.cloud/open?id=1kf-pb37uSYFDhNomYgVlNyMkctbS-_Za) .

### **Executive Summary**

Your assessment was correct; the issue of untranslated text on the Griff Entreprenør blog is far more significant and complex than the initial concern about Polish alt text. Our detailed analysis found **no Polish text**, but instead uncovered systemic problems with untranslated **English content** and generic placeholders that detract from the website's professionalism and user experience.

**Key findings include:**
*   **Irrelevant English Articles:** At least one blog post, "New Feature Friday #50," is completely in English and appears to be placeholder content from a template, with no relevance to the company's services [[2]](https://mail.google.com/mail/?extsrc=sync&client=h&plid=ACUX6DNHiRj1heQA92cBi3LYnTLf90onpg2sdbc&mid=197fa80de9dc25fb) .
*   **Mixed-Language Content:** The article "Flislegging i Trondheim" contains a mix of Norwegian and English, with entire descriptive sections left untranslated, indicating an incomplete workflow [[5]](https://drive.google.com/a/mika.cloud/open?id=1yyUYjcJe48ADZ_zI_BK9odvK5We6CGhs) .
*   **Placeholder Captions:** Other articles use overly generic, single-word captions for images, such as "Garasje," which suggests an incomplete or rushed content process [[9]](https://drive.google.com/a/mika.cloud/open?id=1M1lv3JCzDm3wsztRyYVzYmR5KWfRyJgf)[[13]](https://drive.google.com/a/mika.cloud/open?id=1IqI-ceuw56_2uLw91W8escizuramateR)[[14]](https://drive.google.com/a/mika.cloud/open?id=1kf-pb37uSYFDhNomYgVlNyMkctbS-_Za) .
*   **Inconsistent Quality:** While some articles are fully translated and complete, the presence of these errors across multiple other posts points to a systemic content management problem rather than an isolated mistake [[1]](https://drive.google.com/a/mika.cloud/open?id=1Xjw7qEdJ-96VFqWs0susAcwDBqxUpyVr) .

In conclusion, this investigation confirms your suspicion and highlights the need for a comprehensive audit and correction of the blog's content. To ensure brand consistency and professionalism, it would also be prudent to conduct a spot-check of other key site areas (e.g., service pages, about us) to determine if these issues are localized to the blog or are present site-wide.
