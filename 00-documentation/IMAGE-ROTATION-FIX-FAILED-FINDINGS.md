# Image Rotation Fix Failed - Investigation Findings

**Date**: 2025-10-16
**Investigation Duration**: 45 minutes
**Status**: ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED

---

## 🚨 Executive Summary

### Problem:
CSS fix deployed successfully but images STILL rotated on live site.

### Root Cause:
**Sharp is NOT applying EXIF orientation during image optimization!**

The compress-images.js script creates Sharp instances but never calls `.rotate()`, which is required to apply EXIF orientation metadata.

### Solution:
Add `.rotate()` call to Sharp processing pipeline to auto-rotate images based on EXIF before resizing.

## 📊 Investigation Results

### Phase 1: Current State Verification

#### Finding 1.1: CSS Fix IS Applied ✅
**Live HTML Inspection:**
```html
<img alt="Isolering Trondheim - Rehabilitering"
     src="/images/optimized/rehabilitering/rehabilitering-griff-entreprenor-08.webp"
     style="image-orientation: from-image; max-width: 100%; height: auto;"
     class="w-full rounded-xl my-8 shadow-lg">
```

**Conclusion**: ArticleWrapper.tsx regex replacement worked correctly. Inline styles present in rendered HTML.

#### Finding 1.2: CSS Property Doesn't Work Without Correct Images ❌
**Why CSS Fix Failed:**
- `image-orientation: from-image` only works if EXIF orientation data is present
- Sharp strips EXIF during optimization
- Images are PHYSICALLY rotated in the files themselves
- CSS cannot fix physically rotated image pixels

**Analogy**: Trying to fix a rotated photo with CSS is like trying to rotate a printed photograph by writing CSS on it.

#### Finding 1.3: Images Are Physically Rotated ❌

**Visual Verification:**
- ✅ Backup image: Building SIDEWAYS (4000×3000 landscape, but content is rotated)
- ✅ Source image: Building SIDEWAYS (4000×3000 landscape, but content is rotated)
- ✅ Optimized .jpg: Building SIDEWAYS (2400×1800 landscape, but content is rotated)
- ✅ Optimized .webp: Building SIDEWAYS (2456×1842, but content is rotated)

**Dimensions vs. Visual:**
- File dimensions: 4000×3000 (landscape)
- Visual content: Building should be 3000×4000 (portrait)
- Problem: Image pixels are rotated 90° CCW

#### Finding 1.4: Third Rotated Image Identified ✅

**Article:** isolering-trondheim.html

**Images:**
1. Line 45: `rehabilitering-griff-entreprenor-08.webp` ❌ ROTATED
2. Line 61: `isolering-energisparing-trondheim-202506-3-article.jpg` ❌ NEEDS CHECK
3. Line 70: `isolering-energisparing-trondheim-202506-4-article.jpg` ❌ NEEDS CHECK
4. Line 91: `isolering-energisparing-trondheim-202506-5-article.jpg` ❌ NEEDS CHECK

**Note**: Third image is NOT from rehabilitering folder, but from processed/article folder.

---

### Phase 2: Root Cause Analysis

#### Finding 2.1: EXIF Orientation Data Present ✅

**Source Image EXIF:**
```bash
$ file all-pictures-again/Rehabilitering/rehabilitering-griff-entreprenor-08.jpg
orientation=upper-right (EXIF value 6 = rotate 90° CW)
```

**Camera Info:**
- Manufacturer: Samsung
- Model: SM-A415F
- Photo Date: 2023-06-08
- Orientation: upper-right (needs 90° CW rotation)

**Conclusion**: Source images have correct EXIF data indicating they need rotation.

#### Finding 2.2: Sharp NOT Applying EXIF Rotation ❌

**compress-images.js Analysis:**

**Current Code (Lines 76-90):**
```javascript
let image = sharp(inputPath);
const metadata = await image.metadata();

if (CONFIG.maxWidth || CONFIG.maxHeight) {
  image = image.resize({
    width: CONFIG.maxWidth,
    height: CONFIG.maxHeight,
    fit: 'inside',
    withoutEnlargement: true
  });
}
```

**Problem**: No `.rotate()` call!

**Sharp Documentation:**
> "By default, the output image will be web-friendly sRGB, with additional operations such as resize and rotate performed before format encoding."

BUT: Auto-rotation requires calling `.rotate()` without arguments!

**Missing Code:**
```javascript
let image = sharp(inputPath);
const metadata = await image.metadata();

// ⚠️ THIS IS MISSING:
image = image.rotate(); // Apply EXIF orientation

if (CONFIG.maxWidth || CONFIG.maxHeight) {
  image = image.resize(...);
}
```

#### Finding 2.3: Optimization Pipeline Issue ❌

**Current Flow:**
1. Load image → Sharp instance created
2. Get metadata → EXIF read but not applied
3. Resize → Image resized WITHOUT rotation
4. Compress → Image saved WITHOUT rotation
5. EXIF stripped → Orientation data lost

**Correct Flow:**
1. Load image → Sharp instance created
2. Get metadata → EXIF read
3. **Rotate → EXIF orientation applied**
4. Resize → Correctly oriented image resized
5. Compress → Correctly oriented image saved
6. EXIF stripped → No longer needed

### Phase 3: Why Previous "Fix" Failed

#### My First Attempt (Commit ca226ab):
**What I Did:**
- Rotated SOURCE images 90° CW manually
- Re-optimized images
- Committed changes

**Why It Failed:**
- Rotated images that were ALREADY correct (based on EXIF)
- Made the problem worse (double rotation)

#### My Second Attempt (Commit 9b26955):
**What I Did:**
- Restored source images from backup
- Added CSS: `image-orientation: from-image`
- Re-optimized images

**Why It Failed:**
- Sharp still didn't rotate during optimization
- CSS property doesn't work on stripped EXIF
- Images still physically rotated in files

## 🔍 Technical Deep Dive

### Why image-orientation CSS Failed:

**CSS Property:**
```css
image-orientation: from-image;
```

**Purpose**: Tells browser to respect EXIF orientation metadata

**Why It Doesn't Work:**
1. Sharp strips EXIF during optimization
2. Browser receives image WITHOUT orientation data
3. CSS property has no effect
4. Image pixels are physically rotated in file

**Browser Support:**
- Chrome: ✅ Supported (but needs EXIF)
- Safari: ✅ Supported (but needs EXIF)
- Firefox: ✅ Supported (but needs EXIF)

**Conclusion**: CSS property works, but Sharp removed the EXIF data it needs!

### EXIF Orientation Values:

| Value | Description | Transformation Needed |
|-------|-------------|----------------------|
| 1 | Normal | None |
| 2 | Flip horizontal | Flip H |
| 3 | Rotate 180° | Rotate 180° |
| 4 | Flip vertical | Flip V |
| 5 | Flip H + Rotate 90° CCW | Complex |
| **6** | **Rotate 90° CW** | **90° CW rotation** |
| 7 | Flip H + Rotate 90° CW | Complex |
| 8 | Rotate 90° CCW | 90° CCW rotation |

Our images have **Value 6**: Rotate 90° clockwise

## 📸 Affected Images Analysis

### Confirmed Rotated (Rehabilitering):
1. `rehabilitering-griff-entreprenor-08.jpg` ❌ Needs 90° CW rotation
2. `rehabilitering-griff-entreprenor-09.jpg` ❌ Needs 90° CW rotation

### Needs Investigation (Processed Article):
3. `isolering-energisparing-trondheim-202506-3-article.jpg` ❓
4. `isolering-energisparing-trondheim-202506-4-article.jpg` ❓
5. `isolering-energisparing-trondheim-202506-5-article.jpg` ❓

**Note**: These processed/article images may have been manually rotated or processed differently.

### Potential Additional Images:
All 25 images in Rehabilitering folder from same photo session (Samsung SM-A415F, June 2023) may have similar EXIF orientation issues.

## 💡 Solution Strategy

### THE FIX: Add .rotate() to Sharp Pipeline

**Simple Change:**
```javascript
// IN: compress-images.js, processImage function

// BEFORE:
let image = sharp(inputPath);
const metadata = await image.metadata();

// AFTER:
let image = sharp(inputPath);
const metadata = await image.metadata();
image = image.rotate(); // ✅ Apply EXIF orientation!
```

### Why This Works:

1. **Sharp.rotate()** without arguments reads EXIF orientation tag
2. Applies correct rotation (90° CW for value 6)
3. Updates image dimensions (4000×3000 → 3000×4000)
4. Subsequent resize works on correctly oriented image
5. Output: 2400×1800 portrait (upright building)

### Testing Required:

1. ✅ Images with EXIF orientation=6 (rotate 90° CW)
2. ✅ Images with EXIF orientation=1 (no rotation)
3. ✅ Images with no EXIF data
4. ✅ Verify dimensions after optimization
5. ✅ Visual inspection of optimized output

## 📋 Implementation Plan Preview

### Step 1: Update compress-images.js
- Add `.rotate()` call after Sharp instance creation
- Ensure rotation happens BEFORE resize
- Test with sample images

### Step 2: Re-optimize All Images
- Run compress-images.js on all folders
- Verify output dimensions (should swap to portrait for rotated images)
- Visual inspection of key images

### Step 3: Copy to Public Directory
- Copy optimized images to public/images/optimized
- Ensure all formats (.jpg, .webp) are updated

### Step 4: Build & Deploy
- Run local build
- Test on desktop
- Deploy to Netlify
- Test on mobile devices

### Step 5: Client Verification
- Client tests on their mobile device
- Verify images display upright
- Confirm all articles are correct

## ⚠️ Critical Success Factors

1. **Sharp .rotate() MUST be called** before .resize()
2. **All image formats** must be re-optimized (.jpg, .webp)
3. **Visual verification** required before deployment
4. **Mobile testing** essential (CSS didn't work, this must)
5. **Client confirmation** needed before closing issue
