### ⚠️ REMAINING ENGLISH CONTENT IN FLISLEGGING ARTICLE

**Issue:** Lines 252-421 contain English content that was NOT included in the original 19 translation edits.

| Line | Section | English Content Found |
|------|---------|----------------------|
| 252 | Maintenance intro | "To keep the beauty and durability of your tiled surfaces over time, proper maintenance is crucial:" |
| 255 | Quote | "For daily cleaning, use warm water and a mild, pH-neutral cleaner. Avoid wax-based products that can build up a film on the tiles. For natural stone, use special cleaners designed for this material, and remember regular sealing to protect against stains." |
| 296 | Grout maintenance | "The grout between tiles needs special attention. We recommend regular cleaning with a soft brush and a special grout cleaner, as well as yearly inspection for signs of wear, cracks, or discoloration. Applying grout sealer every 1-2 years will protect against stains and moisture penetration. If you notice damaged grout, it should be repaired to prevent water penetration and damage to the base." |
| 297 | Tile types maintenance | "Different types of tiles need different maintenance. Ceramic and porcelain tiles generally have low maintenance needs and can be cleaned with most non-abrasive cleaners. Natural stone, however, requires regular sealing and special cleaners designed for natural stone. It's also important to wipe up spills immediately, especially from acidic liquids like wine, juice, or vinegar." |
| 299 | FAQ intro | "Based on our extensive experience with tiling projects in Trondheim, we've gathered answers to some of the most common questions our customers ask:" |
