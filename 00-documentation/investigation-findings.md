# Investigation Findings: Griff Entreprenør Blog Content Audit
**Date:** October 15, 2025
**Investigator:** Claude Code
**Scope:** 25 blog articles on https://griff-seo-new.netlify.app/blog

---

## Executive Summary

After conducting a comprehensive investigation of all 25 blog articles, I've identified **one major issue** with untranslated English content in the tile laying article. The "New Feature Friday #50" article mentioned in the feedback document was **not found** in the current codebase (likely already removed). The garage article's image captions are **acceptable** and not as problematic as initially reported.

**Priority Level:** MEDIUM - One critical article requires immediate translation to Norwegian.

### 2. Article Not Found (Likely Already Removed)

#### Article: "New Feature Friday #50 - Huge additions to the journalist database"
**Status:** NOT FOUND
**Search Results:** No matches found for "New Feature Friday", "journalist database", or "AIWire" in any article files
**Conclusion:** This irrelevant English article has likely already been removed from the blog

---

### 3. Minor Issue: Image Alt Text (Acceptable Quality)

#### Article: `garasje-trondheim.html`
**Title:** "Hvordan kan en garasje øke verdien på eiendommen din i Trondheim"
**Severity:** LOW
**Issue:** Image alt text could be more descriptive, but current text is in Norwegian and contextually appropriate

**Current Alt Text Examples:**
- Line 25: "Garasje som øker eiendomsverdi i Trondheim" ✓ Acceptable
- Line 41: "Garasjebygging som smart investering" ✓ Acceptable
- Line 169: "Garasjens innvirkning på eiendomsverdi" ✓ Acceptable

**Assessment:** The feedback document overstated this issue. While the alt text could be more descriptive, it is in Norwegian and provides adequate context. This is NOT a priority fix.

## Root Cause Analysis

**Why did this happen?**

The English content in the flislegging article appears to be from an AI content generation process where:
1. The article structure was generated in Norwegian (headers, key points table)
2. Body content paragraphs were generated in English and not translated
3. Quality control step was missed before publication

**Pattern:** Mixed Norwegian headers with English body text suggests incomplete localization workflow.

## Impact Assessment

### SEO Impact:
- **Negative:** Mixed-language content hurts SEO for Norwegian keywords
- **User Confusion:** Norwegian users encountering English mid-article creates poor UX
- **Professional Image:** Undermines credibility of Griff Entreprenør as local Norwegian company

### Urgency:
- **HIGH** for flislegging article (main content issue)
- **CLOSED** for "New Feature Friday" (already removed)
- **LOW** for garage article (minor, acceptable quality)

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Action Required:
1. **Translate English sections in `flislegging-trondheim-tips.html` to Norwegian**
   - Priority: HIGH
   - Estimated time: 30-45 minutes
   - Impact: Fixes 485+ words of English content

### Optional Improvements:
2. **Enhance image alt text in `garasje-trondheim.html`**
   - Priority: LOW
   - Estimated time: 10 minutes
   - Impact: Minor SEO and accessibility improvement

### Quality Control Process:
3. **Implement pre-publication checklist:**
   - ✓ All body text in Norwegian
   - ✓ Headers match content language
   - ✓ Image alt text is descriptive and in Norwegian
   - ✓ No placeholder or template text remains

---

## Conclusion

The investigation confirms that **24 out of 25 articles are correctly written in Norwegian**. Only the flislegging (tile laying) article requires immediate attention with English-to-Norwegian translation. The previously reported "New Feature Friday" article is no longer present in the codebase, and the garage article's alt text is acceptable.

**Next Steps:** Proceed with implementation plan for surgical translation fixes to the flislegging article.
